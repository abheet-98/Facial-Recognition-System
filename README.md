# Facial-Recognition-System
A project aimed at Computer Vision, facial recognition system was built in Python using OpenCV. It compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match and identifies the person. This project uses various haarcascade classifiers to detect the object for which it has been trained for

# OpenCV
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license. 

# Haar Cascade
A Haar Cascade is basically a classifier which is used to detect the object for which it has been trained for, from the source. The Haar Cascade is trained by superimposing the positive image over a set of negative images. The training is generally done on a server and on various stages.
